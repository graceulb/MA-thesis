sklearn  
lime     
pandas      
numpy   
seaborn  
matplotlib.pyplot    

* LIME was implemented using VScode through Anaconda.

sklearn  
shap  
numpy     
pandas          
seaborn   
matplotlib.pyplot   

* SHAP was implemented using VScode through Anaconda.

Packages needed for the predective model using Anchor as an XAI method: 
sklearn  
numpy   
Anchor-exp        
seaborn
